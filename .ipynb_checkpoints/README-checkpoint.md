## Project Description
In first Jupyter Notebook “Top10.ipynb,” we analyzed what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in the region with ZIP code 10027 and how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020. The top 10 causes are: Noise – Residential (3610), Noise – Street/Sidewalk (3087), HEAT/HOT WATER (2138), Illegal Parking (1118), Non-Emergency Police Matter (862), Illegal Fireworks (779), Noise – Vehicle (647), UNSANITARY CONDITION (628), PLUMBING (465), and Noise (443). The output is a pandas.Series called top10 (as a Python variable), which ranks number of incidents in decreasing order, and which labels the incident type (a string) and take the total number of incidents of this type in 2020 as associated values.

In second Jupyter Notebook “Parking.ipynb,” we analyzed if illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in the region with ZIP code 10027 than they are in general or not. At the same time, we calculated the total number of parking incidents in 10027, and the total number of all incidents: is this fraction greater than or smaller than the total fraction of parking incidents across all ZIP codes?. The fraction of parking incidents in general is 7.49% and the fraction of parking incidents in zip 10027 is 5.21%. Therefore, we got the “false” since Our ZIP 10027 contains a lower proportion of parking incidents than the global value.
